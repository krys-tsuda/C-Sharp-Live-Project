# C-Sharp-Live-Project
Collaboration on MVC web application in C# using Visual Studio, Azure DevOps, and Agile framework.

<p>For this project I was tasked with assisting in the build of a local theatres user friendly webpage. I contributed the home page styling, creation of blog author model class, CRUD page scaffolding and styling. My focus was on creating reusable code that can be easily reviewed and added onto preventing future code conflict. Implemented best practices for functional interface and responsive styling.</p>

<p>Using guidelines, I styled the homepage spotlighting featured performances including a sidebar highlighting sponsors and featuring a donation button. Next I created the blog author model class and updated the database using ASP.NET, ensuring proper design. I then scaffolded the CRUD page designs using MVC framework. Using bootstrap and custom classes I styled the pages with a cohesive design. Applying bootstrap cards to display blog author information and CRUD functionality.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Coming onto a project mid development, I had to make sure I reviewed the project code forseeing code conflict with assigned tasks. To resolve any issues I would trace my steps utilizing previous code and creating custom classes as needed.</li>
    <li>With a project this scale, when assigned a task, initially I had several questions on project practices. I was able to find several answers to my questios in the project wiki/resources. When needed I reached out to project managers to clarify any quesitons.</li>
